# Educational Volunteering Trip

This trip offers an unparalleled insight into the life of the Zanzibar people, including an educational look into the cultures, aromas, food, music, and history of this unique country.

Volunteers will become lifelong friends with the people they travel with. It is a shared experience, where individuals are out of their comfort zone in a totally different culture â€“ yet it is a truly unforgettable and life changing adventure. Each participant will make a huge difference in the lives of thousands of children who attend public schools in Zanzibar. Although Zanzibar is considered one of the more prosperous regions in East Africa, half the population lives below the poverty line and its education system is underfunded and overpopulated.

## Challenges Facing The Schools

Many public schools offer opportunities for education that are virtually free, thereby catering to large numbers of disadvantaged children from poor families. Their main goal is to create an enriching teaching environment, even though they lack the key resources and funding which could improve the infrastructure tremendously. The sheer number of students causes the limited amount resources to be stretched wide and thin.

## Why Should You Get Involved?

Your decision to be a volunteer will provide a necessary service to the schools of Zanzibar. The students need to be taught material in important subjects such as English, Math, Geography, and Science. You will help the schools teach students based on your knowledge of specific subjects. An emphasis is also placed on sports as a subject, in order to help the students not only improve their academic performance but also to build them up physically, mentally, and emotionally. The complete experience of school should equip them with the discipline to face the challenges of life, and to be able to bring forward solutions for themselves and for their community.

We trust that the volunteers will be able to skillfully explain the spoken and written concepts of the English language, as well as teach other subjects that they are well versed in. The volunteers will also be able to physically contribute towards the renovation and maintenance of schools, including painting, building, and even adding new classes.

## Our primary targets
