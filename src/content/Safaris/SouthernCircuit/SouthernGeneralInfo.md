## Southern Circuit Safaris

The national parks in southern Tanzania cover large areas and offer amazing game-viewing experiences in remote areas. The safaris we offer involve overnight stays in comfortable lodging, where expert safari guides will drive you around in open SUV’s.

This safari circuit is one of the best in southern Africa, there is no big migration event like in the northern circuit but the animals are diverse and plentiful. This is the perfect trip for those who are seeking a connection to nature without the overcrowding that is a problem at many of Africa’s national parks. Please direct yourself to the previous page for more information about the individual parks.
