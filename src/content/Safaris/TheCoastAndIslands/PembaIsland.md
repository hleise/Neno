## Pemba Island

The island of Pemba forms a part of the Zanzibar Archipelago, and is located approximately 50 kilometers north of Unguja island. The trio of Pemba, Unguja, and Mafia Island form the coveted “Spice Islands”. Not to be confused with the Indonesian spice islands, the fertile land from this trio is used for farming a number of different spices that are important to Zanzibar’s economy.

The main cities in Pemba are Chake-Chake (the capital), Mkoani, and Wete, which is the largest city. The fertility of this island allows citizens to grow their own food, including rice, coconuts, and bananas among many other crops.

Pemba is also known for its dive sites, which have steep drop-offs and are surrounded by untouched coral and diverse marine life. In addition, Pemba has the most profitable fishing grounds for game fishing on the Swahili Coast. __Read More__
