## Northern Circuit Safaris

Tanzania's first safari areas were located in the north, this northern circuit remains its most famous safari area to this day. The Ngorongoro Crater and the Rift Valley's Lake Manyara are among the northern circuitâ€™s most popular attractions. In addition, the Serengeti's great migration is one of the world's most breathtaking wildlife displays, it comes as no surprise that it attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year!

Unfortunately, the effect of mass tourism is evident in certain areas as seen by the sheer number of tour buses that roam around. That is why we strive to avoid hotspots while still showing visitors all that the attractions that the northern circuit has to offer.
