## 4 days - Lake Manyara, Serengeti, and Ngorongoro

**Day 1: Lake Manyara**
Depart Arusha in the morning for Lake Manyara, followed by an afternoon game drive, and concluded with dinner and an overnight stay at a campsite or lodge.

**Day 2: Serengeti**
Following breakfast, we'll depart for the Serengeti and pass through Olduvai Gorge, where Louis and Mary Leakey discovered the fossils of our early primate ancestors dating back to nearly two million years ago. Meals will be served at the campsite or lodge, where you will stay overnight.

**Day 3: Serengeti (continued)**
This will be a full day in the Serengeti plains, here we will search for wild game you might have missed in the previous game drives. There will be both morning and afternoon game drives in order to fully experience the plains. Once again, meals will be served at the campsite or lodge that you will stay at overnight.

**Day 4: Ngorongoro**
After breakfast, we will drive to the gate of Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Here, we will register to enter and then descend the steep track to the crater floor. Afterwards, you will have the opportunity to explore the natural habitat of this vast 2000 foot caldera, where you will also enjoy a picnic lunch. The day will conclude with a late evening drive to Arusha for an overnight stay at a hotel.
