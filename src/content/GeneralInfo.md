## Important Information

The population of Zanzibar is predominantly Muslim coupled with a rich Swahili culture. Because of the resulting religious and cultural traditions, following the dress code is important in order to not upset the locals. Men and women should dress appropriately when away from the beach, it is suggested that you cover your shoulders and knees. Normal swimwear on the beach is fine, however nude and topless sunbathing is absolutely not tolerated. When in villages or in Stone Town, having on only beach-appropriate clothing will offend the locals.

Zanzibari people are generally very warm and hospitable, so please respect them and ask for permission before taking photos of them or filming them. Do not take photos or film at sensitive government sites, including the State House, seaport, airport, or any military sites. If you are uncertain, it is always better to ask.

Public consumption of alcohol is not permissible, with the exception of hotels and tourist areas, as well as bars and some restaurants. Public displays of affection such as kissing are not customary, and generally considered offensive unless behind closed doors. Mosques are sacred places, and the only entry to non-Muslims is when they are accompanied by a person of the faith. This person can show a non-muslim around at times other than during congregational prayers, which occur five times daily. When offering or accepting things, it is customary to offer and receive with your right hand.
