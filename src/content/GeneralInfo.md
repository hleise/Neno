# About Zanzibar

## Short History of the Islands

The Zanzibar Archipelago consists of two big sister Islands, Unguja and Pemba, which are situated in the Indian Ocean and are joined by more than 50 small Isles. Unguja is a unique coral island that covers an area of approximately 1464 km<sup>2</sup> (565 mi<sup>2</sup>), whereas Pemba covers about 988 km<sup>2</sup> (381 mi<sup>2</sup>). These islands are located 35 km off the coast of Mainland Tanzania, between 39 degrees longitude and 6 degrees latitude south of equator.

Zanzibar was an independent country until April 26, 1964, when it was united with Tanganyika to form The United Republic of Tanzania. Zanzibar still has its own Government, House of Representatives, as well as a certain degree of autonomy within the United Republic of Tanzania.

The history of Zanzibar dates back many centuries ago, most notably during the Age of Exploration. In 1498, the Portuguese Empire was the first European power to seize control of Zanzibar, and kept it for more than 200 years. Then in 1698, Zanzibar fell under the control of the Sultanate of Oman. In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, the Sultan of Oman officially moved his capital city to Zanzibar.

During the reign of the Sultan, spice cultivation was introduced and developed, clove trees being the main crop. In addition to spice trading, Zanzibar was a strategic meeting point for the slave trade in East Africa. This horrendous trade was unfortunately widespread in Africa at the time, and the men and women that suffered through this are honored in Zanzibar through numerous memorials. As a result of it’s unique location and culture, Zanzibar became the most important town in East and Central Africa.

## Geography

The Zanzibar Islands have a total of 2,461 km<sup>2</sup> (950 mi<sup>2</sup>), the other islands that make up the Zanzibar Archipelago are the following: Tumbatu Island, Chumbe Island, Mnemba Island, Changuu Island, and Misali Island. Tumbatu lies at the northeast end of the Unguja islands, and has the ruins of what were once Zanzibar’s main settlements. Chumbe is famous for its biodiversity and beautiful coral reefs and is perfect for snorkeling, Mnemba is commonly acknowledged as the best site for diving. Changuu Island (also known as Prison Island) is a good site for snorkeling due to the presence of endangered Tortoises. Misali is a protected island off the coast of Pemba, complete with breathtaking coral reefs.

Pemba Island is the second largest Island in the Zanzibar Archipelago, it was referred to as “Jazira Al-Khudra” by Arabic mariners, which means “the Green Island”. Pemba is famous for its large production of cloves, and has one of the best diving experiences in East Africa.

## Religion

The majority of Christians on the Zanzibar Islands are from the Tanzanian mainland, who have moved to the islands because it suits their relaxed way of life.

## Security

Tanzania is generally a safe country, but bad eggs exist as they do in every tourist destination across the world. Keep your eyes on your belongings. Don't walk in the towns or cities late at night, instead opt to take a taxi. Don't carry irreplaceable items or large amounts of cash with you, and beware of pickpockets and hawkers. Use hotel safety deposit boxes to safeguard valuables and make sure to obtain a receipt. Leave valuable jewelry at home.

## Communication

There are many methods of communication available in Zanzibar, every hotel will have a telephone for you to use. You also have the option of buying your own sim card chip from services like Zantel, Tigo, Vodacom, Airtel, and Halotel. Make sure to remember to take your public ID for registration, because you will need it before you can access cell services. Many hotels offer free Wi-Fi where you can access the internet from your own personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. If for some reason your hotel does not have free wifi, there are internet cafes at the Zanzibar Old Post office where you pay as you use.

Major foreign currencies are accepted, especially USD and Euros. Travellers cheques are accepted and can be converted at banks and bureau de changes in the main towns and tourist areas. Keep in mind that credit cards are not widely accepted and carry poor exchange rates. ATM facilities are available in Stone Town but can potentially be unreliable. If you want to buy goods and services from the local people, it is advised that you convert some of your currency to Tanzanian Shillings at a bureau de change.

## Medical Support

All Travelers:

Make sure you are up-to-date on routine vaccines before every trip. These vaccines include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, polio vaccine, and your yearly flu shot.

Most travelers should get vaccinated for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. If you are traveling from a country with risk of yellow fever (The United States is NOT one of these countries), it is required that you show proof of vaccination for yellow fever upon entry to Tanzania.

Although there is very little Malaria in Zanzibar, it is also advisable to take anti-malarial precautions. This could mean a suitable course of prophylactics before departure, consult your doctor or travel clinic while planning your trip. You are advised to cover yourself up after sunset and use mosquito repellent on exposed skin. We advise you to take some sunblock lotion due to the many sunny locations in Zanzibar.

Visitors with specific medical needs should bring an extra supply of any prescribed medication, stored separately in case of loss or damage. One last important thing to remember is that medical facilities in Zanzibar are limited, therefore you are advised to have comprehensive travel insurance to cover the unlikely event of serious accident or illness.  

## Electric Current

Electric Power is 220V - 240V running at 50hz. The plug type used in Zanzibar is “Type D & G (British)”. Make sure to bring a universal adapter and flashlight.

## Etiquette

The citizens of Zanzibar are fairly conservative in regards to clothing, therefore following the dress code is important in order to not upset the locals. Men and women should dress appropriately when away from the beach, it is suggested that you cover your shoulders and knees. Normal swimwear on the beach is fine, however nude and topless sunbathing is absolutely not tolerated. When in villages or in Stone Town, having on only beach-appropriate clothing will offend the locals.

During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan where they are fasting, it is considered bad manners to eat, drink, or smoke in public. So we ask you to not offend them and keep those activities private during the month of Ramadan.

## What to Take With You

Pack lightweight washable clothes, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Long sleeves and trousers in light-colored fabrics help discourage insect bites. Women should carry a wrap to cover their legs in the village and towns, because revealing clothes can cause offense. Feel free to wear a swimsuit in designated areas.
Bring batteries for your camera with you, protect your camera from dust and keep equipment in cool areas when not in use. It is courteous to ask permission before photographing local people. Do not take photos or film at sensitive government sites including the State House, Seaport, Airport, or Military sites. If uncertain, it is always better to ask.

## Tipping

Not obligatory, but a tip for exceptional service (max 10%) is appreciated. $10 - $25 per day for the driver or tour guide is much appreciated.

## Shopping
The tourist areas including Stone Town and the Spice Farms, have shops that sell a wide range of souvenirs, jewelry, and trinkets. Don't be afraid to haggle at roadside stalls (Your driver/ guide will advise you on where to shop and what reasonable prices are). The most popular souvenirs are wooden carvings, curios, and a famous love stone "Tanzanite", which are all sold at most souvenir shops.
