## Sunset Cruise in Zanzibar

Sunset Dhow Cruise: 16:30 - 18:30

Step into our local dhow vessel, relax, and let us sail you away on a magical sunset cruise to end your day. Our sunset cruise leaves Stone Town in the late afternoon and cruises along the coast, slicing through the turquoise water.

The sounds of the hustle and bustle of busy people in Stone Town grow faint in the distance until they completely disappear. As the captain sails the dhow vessel with ease, the crew will be serving refreshments and light snacks for you to enjoy. Just sit back and experience the romantic setting with the beautiful range of colors from the African sunset.  

Onboard the dhow, we have a personal guide who will accompany you on your cruise and give you a tour of Stone Town from sea. The guide will also be able to answer any questions that you may ask him.
