## Jozani Forest Tour

The Jozani Forest is the home of the red colobus monkey, a rare species found only in Zanzibar. These monkeys are full of character and roam freely, but are unfortunately endangered in the area. Jozani is also home to other species including Sykes monkeys, chameleons, and bush pigs.

The elusive Zanzibar leopard (last seen several years ago) is said to feed here at night, we close the reservation after sunset for this reason. Jozani has an excellent nature trail and the guides are well-trained and informative. A walk through this impressive forest is one of Zanzibarâ€™s highlights. The half-day trip includes transport, entrance fees (8 USD), and the guide. Because of easy access, it is recommended that you combine this trip with the __Jambiani Village Tour__ or the __Spice Tour__.
