## Unguja Ukuu Boat Trip

The lush and green West Coast of Zanzibar showcases the diversity of the environment. This very special boat trip starts in Unguja Ukuu, far away from the tourist tracks.

We will take you to the small uninhabited islands, Miwi and Nianembe, and the town of Kwale in the protected Menai Bay, where you will witness the unique flora and fauna of Zanzibar's tropical islands. You will most likely see big groups of dolphins and other sea creatures as we embark on our journey.

There are unspoiled beaches with glooming white sands, perfect for relaxation. The sea around the islands is also ideal for snorkeling if you desire to explore. We'll arrange a barbecue with fresh caught fish, delicious local dishes, and tropical fruits.

**The day trip includes the transfer from Stone Town, motorboat/sailboat, guide, snorkeling equipment, and lunch.**
