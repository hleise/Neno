## Kidichi Village Tour

During this cultural day tour, you will have an opportunity to visit the local people of Kidichi and explore their culture.

Kidichi is a village located at the highest altitude in Zanzibar, about 110 meters above sea level. This village is very close to the majority of spice farms in Zanzibar and is therefore located on fertile land. This cultural visit will take you through the Persian bath, which was built by the first Sultan of Zanzibar for his Persian wife. While in the village you will see how local people prepare their daily meals, and you will visit local families to see the preparation of coconut oil. This is also where you will experience and participate in henna paintings with the locals. This tour can be extended to view the harvesting of in-season spices at the nearby farms. This tour will include a delicious lunch of typical Zanzibar cuisine served in a local house.
