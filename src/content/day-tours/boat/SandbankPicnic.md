## Sandbank Picnic


**Sandbank Picnic: 9:30am - 2:30pm**


This is a daily scheduled trip, but is subject to the level of tide during the day as well as  weather conditions.

This full day excursion is enjoyable for everyone, from those who wish to completely relax to those who want adventure and excitement.

The trip will begin after boarding the dhow at the __hotel__, where we will embark towards Bawe Island. There, a guide will take you snorkeling to see the stunning collection of colored corals and tropical fish. Afterwards, we will hop back onboard and sail away to a sandbank where there are several species of birds with unique characteristics.
A seemingly uninhabited sandbank in the ocean suddenly comes to life with millions of birds flying overhead, and numerous ghost crabs scurrying across the golden sands.

After lunch, relax on the sandbank and listen to the birds around you as the waves lap against the shore.

We will slowly sail back to __Stone Town__ after soaking up the sun, our arrival time back at shore will be approximately 2:30pm.
