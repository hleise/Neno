## Prison Island Boat Trip

Formerly operating as a prison for slaves as well as a quarantine station, Prison Island gives you a chance to escape for some peace and quiet.

The island lies just off the Old Stone Town, and is home to giant tortoises that were imported from the Seychelles in the late 19th century.

The island is bordered with a beautiful coral reef, and is ideal for snorkeling. There is also the option of sunbathing on the lovely white beach. This island tour is excellent for a day trip, and we will serve refreshments throughout.

Prison Island also has a small restaurant where you can enjoy freshly caught fish. The half-day or full-day trip includes the boat ride, entrance fees, and snorkeling equipment.
