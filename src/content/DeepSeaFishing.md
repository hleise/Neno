## Deep Sea Fishing

The spice island of Zanzibar is home to some of the best big game and deep sea fishing opportunities in the Indian Ocean.

Come out and join us for a day of big game fishing in the waters of Zanzibar, the fishing charters are fully rigged and ready to take you out for an experience you will never forget! The prime location for this activity is at the northern tip of Zanzibar in Nungwi, a prominent fishing village. We fish by trolling a combination of lures, or natural dead baits (Ballyhoo or strips), or live bait.

The skippers and crew are also experienced at all disciplines of fishing, whether your requirements be spinning, fly fishing, jigging, popping for the Giant Trevally, power chumming, or drifting with baits. The comfortable fishing boats are staffed with our resourceful crews and are well equipped, every fishing trip is catered and your complete satisfaction out on the water is our mission.

The crystal waters are inhabited by Billfish such as the Striped, Black, and Blue varieties of Marlin. The acrobatic Sailfish and the elusive Shortbill Spearfish also like to make appearances in these waters! More species you may encounter on your journey include the Yellowfin Tuna, Dorado, Wahoo, Barracuda, Kingfish (Trevally), as well as King and Queen Mackerel. The lesser game fish include the Bonito tuna, Skipjack tuna and the Rainbow Runner. The multitude of fish that make their home in our area of the Indian Ocean provide endless hours of adrenalin filled Game Fishing!

The boats are available for half day or full day charters, and the more experienced anglers can opt for night fishing trips to catch the Broadbill Swordfish, known the "Gladiator of the Sea".
