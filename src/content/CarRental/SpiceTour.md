## Spice Tour

The history of Zanzibar would be incomplete without cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper, and many other spices which are essential ingredients in a Zanzibariâ€™s everyday life. Zanzibar and spice have been involved in a romantic entanglement dating back to the 16th century, and have been an important part of the economy ever since. The spice fields can be seen in the plantations just outside Zanzibar Town, therefore the spice tour is also is a fantastic opportunity to see the countryside and rural areas of Zanzibar, as well as connect with the local people.

We have developed a special spice tour with in-depth information not only about spices, but also organically grown herbs and a detailed description about their uses in traditional dishes. We also explore their use in cures for ailments, and even for dyeing traditional ceremonial outfits for weddings and festivals. We have knowledgeable guides trained by a famous herbalist in Zanzibar named Mr. Madawa.

Our guided walking tour passes through villages and spice plantations, on the way you will see workers climbing trees in search of specific plants and barks. You will be able to see, feel, and taste everything along the way, and we will decorate you with palm-leaf accessories such as ties, rings, bracelets, and glasses. At the spice farms you will also have an opportunity to taste some of the exotic fruits of Zanzibar.

After the tour we invite you to join us for an opulent traditional Swahili lunch served in a local house, where you can taste the spices that you have seen during the tour in the food. The tour includes visiting the Kidichi Persian Baths, which were built in 1850 by the first Sultan of Zanzibar as a gift for his Persian wife.

The best place to buy fresh spices is directly from the source, at the spice farms.
The half-day trip includes transport, guide, entrance fees, and a superb lunch.
