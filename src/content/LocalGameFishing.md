## Local Game Fishing

Forget fishing in a big modern vessel with the latest tools! In this trip, we offer the unique opportunity to sail out to sea with a Zanzibari fisherman and see what fishing for a living is really all about.

We set sail from one of East Africa's oldest bays where the horizon is dotted with ngalawas, which are local fishing boats with outriggers. We will equip you with simple fishing gear which locals use to catch kingfish, yellowfin tuna, barracuda and groupers.

A real adventure awaits you!
The half-day and full-day trip includes the boat ride, fishing guide, local fishing gear, fruits, and drinks.
