## Safari Blue

Experience the best sea excursion in Zanzibar!

This tour starts from the village of Fumba in Southwest Zanzibar, and we will take you to see the beautiful Menai Bay. This conservation area includes sandbanks, islands, and coral reefs.

In the morning we will set up on one of the gorgeous sandbanks where you can just relax or participate in guided aquatic activities if you desire. We have quality snorkeling equipment and our experienced snorkeling guides will show you the pristine coral reef, which is teeming with tropical aquatic life, a lesson is also available for beginners. There will be plentiful fresh coconuts and local snacks.

After snorkeling we will go to Kwale island, where we have our famous “desert island” restaurant. The lunch buffet includes fish, slipper lobster, calamari and more, all of which are served hot from the grill. Our crew will also prepare and present a food tasting with a large selection of delicious tropical fruits, cold sodas, and beer. Ready yourself for a delicious Zanzibari seafood lunch with grilled fish and slipper lobster, complemented with coffee and Amarula liqueur. We will end the day by returning to Fumba in traditional lateen sailing boats.

When the tide permits, we will explore the natural lagoon found on Kwale island. Surrounded by a mangrove forest, swimming in the lagoon will be an unforgettable experience.

The dhows are traditional sailing boats, hand-built from African mahogany and finished to the very highest standards. They are comfortable and well equipped with outboard motors, VHF marine radios, inflatable life jackets, sunshades, boarding ladders, waterproof bags and of course first aid kits. We hold marine and public liability insurance.

Safari Blue explores the Menai Bay Conservation Area, which is home to two different species of dolphins, the Indo-Pacific humpback and the bottlenose. We are lucky enough to see dolphins on the vast majority of our excursions.

Menai Bay has been designated as a Conservation Area since 1998 due to its outstanding natural beauty. The bay has a number of pristine sandbanks which were naturally carved by the sea, wind, and waves. The sandbanks and uninhabited islands that litter the bay are perfect stepping stones to explore the area. Join the crew for a sail on an “ngalawa”- a local canoe with outriggers which have been carved from a single mango tree.

When Safari Blue comes to an end, we will return in a traditional lateen sailboat as the full splendor of the African sunset reveals itself.
