## Dolphin Tours

The most popular dolphin spotting site in Zanzibar is located in the **Kizimkazi Village**. This village is located on the Southern Coast of __Zanzibar Island__ where you can see both bottlenose and humpback dolphins.

The shallow coastal waters around Kizimkazi provide an ideal hangout for dolphins that come for the reliable food supply, to nurse their young, and to rest and socialize. Several bottlenose dolphins stay at Kizimkazi all year-round, whereas the shy humpback dolphins make their appearance a little more irregularly. The dolphin tour is best experienced very early in the morning, because as the sun rises, the dolphins escape the heat by diving deeper into the ocean.

For guests staying in Stone Town, we will pick you up from your hotel at 6:00am. For guests staying at beach hotels, we will pick you up at 5:00am.

You can decide to do the trip later in the afternoon, but the probability of seeing dolphins is very low. Although dolphin-spotting is a popular activity, sightings aren't guaranteed and swimming with dolphins is a rare occurrence. Just like with other wild animals, spotting dolphins requires time and patience as they are in their natural environment. Dolphin tours last two to three hours, and the best time of the year to see these extraordinary mammals is between **October and February**.

The dolphin trip can be combined with the __Jozani Forest tour__, as the forest is on the way to Kizimkazi. We pass through the Jozani forest on the way back from dolphin tour.
