## Flying to Northern Tanzania

The easiest way to access safaris in northern Tanzania is through Kilamanjaro International Airport (JRO/HTKJ), which is located 45 minutes east of Arusha. Arusha is the city where many of the safaris in this area start, including the Serengeti, Ngorongo, Lake Manyara, and Tarngire.

The vast majority of flights that fly from outside Africa to Kilimanjaro, arrive daily from Amsterdam and always land in the evening.

However, flights from the Addis Ababa Airport in Ethiopia and the Jomo Kenyatta Airport in Kenya will allow you a number of options to reach the Kilimanjaro airport and still have time to spend during the day you arrive.
