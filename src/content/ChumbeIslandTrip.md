## Chumbe Island Trip

Chumbe Island is situated 8 miles southwest of Zanzibar Town, and covers an area of approximately 50 acres. It is an uninhabited island dominated by forested area with coral rag, the western shore of the island is bordered by a coral reef with exceptional biodiversity and beauty.

Based on the initiative of the Chumbe Island Coral Park Ltd, a private company created for the management of Chumbe, the government declared the island as a protected area in 1994.

The island can be reached in 45 minutes by a boat ride from Mbweni Beach, Chumbe contains 40 acres of undisturbed forest and is surrounded by a virgin coral reef. The sanctuary has more than 200 pieces of pristine stone corals, and about 400 species of fish, turtles, and dolphins regularly pass by.

For a day trip, only a fixed number of people are allowed to travel to the island, which costs less than 14 USD per person. You will participate in a guided hike through the small scenic forest, afterwards you can decide to snorkel or swim, and then eat lunch and relax.
